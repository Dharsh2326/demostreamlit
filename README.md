# Hackathon CV Starter Project

## Problem Statement
(To be updated when released)

## Approach
This project is a simple Computer Vision web app built with **Streamlit** and **OpenCV**.  
It allows users to upload an image and apply basic filters (Grayscale, Edge Detection, Blur).

## How to Run Locally
```bash
# create and activate environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (on Windows use venv\Scripts\activate)

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the app
streamlit run app.py
